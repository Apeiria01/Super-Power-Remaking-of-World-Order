				Your city's efficiency fades with the distance from your capital due to corruption. Corruption happens in cities you founded other than capital as well as all annexed cities.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The city's corruption and the distance from your capital follows such rules:
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]less than 8 tiles - no corruption
				[NEWLINE]1/8 of the map length (at least 14 tiles, at most 18 tiles) - low corruption
				[NEWLINE]1/5 of the map length(at least 26 tiles) - medium corruption
				[NEWLINE]more than 1/3 of the map length (at least 36 tiles) - heavy corruption
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Corruption will cause the output of Production, Gold, Science lost in those cities by a certain percent.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Moving Spies to your city reduces the corruption level of your city, as follows:
				[NEWLINE]Level 1 and Level 2 Spies: The city corruption level is reduced by one level and at most reduce to LV 1.
				[NEWLINE]Level 3 Spy: Completely eliminate city corruption levels.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_YELLOW]Note[ENDCOLOR]: In the current version, corruption has been represented by the "corruption score", the past 1-tile map distance provides 100 corruption scores ("Administrative cost"), the corruption threshold is also the same as in the past (only increased by 100 times), the corruption score can be reduced in more ways now than in the past, you can see the corruption report/preview in the UI panel below City Banner.

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1: Choose the suitable policy. Corruption is closely related to the structure of power. Policies focusing on decentralization, like Province can effective reduce the corruption in all cites.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2: Build anti-corruption buildings. Constabulary and Police Station can reduce the corruption in the cities where they are built. However they are very expensive to maintain. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3: Create puppet of distant cities. Sometimes a puppet can produce more than a normal distant city. Becareful if you create a puppet by selling the City Hall, all anit-corruption buildings will be removed at the same time.[NEWLINE]4:Move your Capital. After moving your new Capital, the levels of all city halls will be recalculated according to the location of your new Capital. It is the most efficient way to locate your Capital in the center of your empire. </Text>

[NEWLINE]2, Use its mobility wisely, after charging, shift to safe position to evade from enemy counter-attacks.

[NEWLINE]4,If the enemy’s anti-tank firepower is strong, try to give your tanks "Armored Plating" Promotion to improve their survivability.[ [NEWLINE]5, NEVER use it to attack the countering units.

Their task is not to charge into enemy lines but to "gank".[NEWLINE]2, They can work with heavy mounted units nicely. Use their "sunder" ability to sunder the enemy to soften their defense and then let your knight crush them.[NEWLINE]3, They can also work in small groups away from your main force. You need at least two mounted archers, one promoted with "sunder" and the other, "hunt down". Use the "sunder" unit to wound the enemy and soften its defense, then let the "hunt down" unit deal damage, since the bonus can be as high as 100%, nobody can stands several turns of such attack, even the enemy is an unit of advanced era.[NEWLINE]4, Don’t forget they can still melee! Use its melee attack against enemy ranged units, especially the weak but dangerous siege weapons. Sometimes you need to deal a certain amount of damage to sunder the enemy, because their melee combat strength is higher than range. [NEWLINE]5, For the same reason, they are capable for defensive tasks, use them to cover your ranged units if needed. Note that the bonus vs wounded units is also effective while defending. [NEWLINE]6, Protect your experienced elites, they are much more useful than recruits. After earning the "logistics", one unit can use its ranged attack to sunder the enemy then use the anti-wounded bonus to serious damage or even kill the enemy. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Their range combat strength is not as strong as the archery units of the same era.  Use your archers to shoot them from a safe distance and can deal critical damage to them. If with "barrage" promotion, archers can easily slow them down. [NEWLINE]2, The siege weapons can only do very limited damage to them(they belong to mounted units). Don’t waste your ammo on them.  [NEWLINE]3, For the same reason, use units with anti-mounted ability to attack them to deal fatal damage. [NEWLINE]4, If the enemy MOunted Archery Unit has the "hunt down" promotion, don’t use wounded units to attack them. As mentioned above, it is still effective when defending! [NEWLINE]5, In higher difficulty levels, the rich AI will build lots of them to trouble you. AI will only use its melee attacks but that is bad enough. So always make your troops stay in neat formation followed by reserve force – if AI uses them to sunder your frontline units, you can quickly draw them back and fill the position with reserve force. </Text>

[NEWLINE]3, Unlike the original Civ 5 games, helicopters don’t start with anti-tank bonus, if you need them to attack enemy tanks you need to promote them with "ambush". However this is less efficient.

[NEWLINE]2, The siege weapons can only do very limited damage to them (they are floating in the air). Don’t waste your ammo on them.  [NEWLINE]3, Modern Archery Units (machine guns, bazookas, ATGM vehicles) can deal "acceptable" damage to helicopters since they have a better range combat strength and can slow them down with the "barrage" promotion. [NEWLINE]4, If the enemy helicopter has the "hunt down" promotion, don’t use wounded units to attack them. It is still effective when defending! [NEWLINE]5, In higher difficulty levels, the rich AI will build lots of them to trouble you. AI will only use its melee attacks but that is bad enough. So always make your troops stay in neat formation followed by reserve force. Keep an eye on your siege weapons and heavy artilleries, AI helicopters love rushing to them from the fog of war! </Text>

Use them to destroy the enemy knights or tanks who have pushed too far from their frontline. [NEWLINE]3, Anti-tank units and anti-air units can perform ranged attacks. Use them wisely to avoid unnecessary damage. [NEWLINE]4, Use infantry units or mobile units to cover them from enemy ranged attacks.

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, they are usually slower than their countering units. Why not take a detour other than directly run into them?  [NEWLINE]2, The archery units, siege weapons, heavy artilleries can deal fatal damage to them. Use them to wipe them out to clear the path.

[NEWLINE]2, After earned the "barrage" promotion, they can pin down the enemy units to stop them from advancing or escaping. However, you are still recommended to earn "accuracy" first since you must have enough firepower to trigger the pinned down effect.[NEWLINE]3, Gating guns and machine guns are very effective to take down enemy infantry units but weak attacking tanks. This will change after upgrading to bazookas; they will no longer have bonus vs infantry but vs tanks. [NEWLINE]4, The archery units and counter units will join hands in the last from. The last archery unit shown up in the game is the ATGM vehicle. As a result, you may consider cultivate some elite counter units with the "blitz" promotion, after upgrading to the ATGM vehicle, the "blitz" promotion can multiply with "logistics" promotion which will make it can shoot up to three times per turn![NEWLINE]5,After earning "logistics" promotion, it can attack twice per turn but the combat strength is reduced by 25%. So choose it wisely. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, they can counter-attack ranged attacks but they are very weak in melee combat. Use your mobile units to crush them other than use ranged unit to shoot. [NEWLINE]2, Siege weapons have a longer shooting range and higher range combat strength, so they can cause considerable damage to them free from being fought back.  [NEWLINE]3,  Although the "barrage" promotion doesn’t always function well for human players’ units, AI units use it quite disgustedly. So don’t rush too far if the AI has many archery units or your units may never come back. </Text>

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Super Power Mod offers you more powerful and effective nuclear weapons, you must treat them with extreme caution. An irresponsible leader can easily ruin the whole planet only by pushing the wrong button. </Text>

			<Text>Cause: Nuclear detonations will spread fallout over tiles on the map. After 0.5% of the tiles of the whole map are covered by fallout, the nuclear winter event will be triggered. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Effect: There are four stages in the nuclear winter. It will get to the next stage if more nuclear weapons are launched. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1, Nuclear Winter Warning - The proportion of Fallout tiles: 0.5%- 1%. You will receive a warning if more nuclear weapons are detonated. [NEWLINE]2, Nuclear Winter Strikes - The proportion of Fallout tiles: 1%- 5%. All tiles with Food Output larger than 3 will reduce by 1 for every new nuclear detonation, until it reaches 3. This will slow down the population growth in all cities. [NEWLINE]3, Nuclear Winter Deteriorates - The proportion of Fallout tiles: 5%- 10%. All tiles with Food Output will reduce by 1 for every new nuclear detonation, until it reaches 1. This will leads to global famine. [NEWLINE]4, Nuclear Winter Apocalypse - The proportion of Fallout tiles > 10%. All tiles' Food and Production output will reduce to 0 with new nuclear detonations. All survivors will starve to death. The global productivity is backed to the Stone Age.</Text>

			<Text> Unfortunately, the nuclear winter is an irreversible process. Once happened, the climate can never be restored. However, there is still ways to prevent it. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1, One nuclear explosion cannot cause the nuclear winter, only a global nuclear war can be strong enough to make it happen. Since the event is triggered by calculating the total number of fallout tiles of the map, many nuclear detonations within a limited area (kinds of nuclear tests) won’t cause the nuclear winter. [NEWLINE]2, You can slow down the nuclear winter process by scrubbing out the fallout tiles. This will stop it from entering to the next stage but cannot restore it to its previous condition. [NEWLINE]3, The best way to prevent the nuclear winter is to stop the nuclear warfare - the Nuclear Non-Proliferation is very important. [NEWLINE]4, If the nuclear winter gets to its worst condition, it will be the end of the human civilizations. However, you still have a little chance to win: waiting for a cultural or diplomatic, or even time victory and it should be less than 10 years. </Text>

			<Text>In Super Power Mod, there are something new about the City States and you need to pay attention.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. City States can produce their own strategic resources. [NEWLINE]Each City State has 4 [ICON_RES_HORSE] Horses, 4 [ICON_RES_IRON] Iron, 4 [ICON_RES_COAL] Coal, 4 [ICON_RES_OIL] Oil and 4 [ICON_RES_ALUMINUM] Aluminum of their own, even they donot have those resources in their land. As a result, you are allowed to give them units with resource requirement and needless to worry about they will suffer from resource penalty. Your City State allies will also provide those strategic resources for you once you have researched the certain Technologies. Therefore, you are free from lacking of strategic resources if you have many allied City States. It will be very helpful for small nations. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. Money is less effective for buying out City States. [NEWLINE]Money can't buy real friends. The Gold gifts are very ineffective in Super Power Mod. Instead, completing missions from City States will greatly improve your relationships with them. If you really want to maintain good relationships with City States, you are highly recommended to adopt the Patronage policy tree. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. Your units as a gift will spend only 1 turn to travel to the City State. [NEWLINE]You can give units to City States more often. This is a very important way to maintain your relationships with them and help them to defend their lands. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4. City States have bonus on city-defense. [NEWLINE]Each City State has a 50% bonus on their city defense to defend them from barbarian or aggressive nations in the early game. However they are still weak when invaded by strong nations. You should depoly troops to protect your allied City States or give them units as gifts.</Text>

				A Cistern is a water storage facility built with artificial materials and has the function of preventing seepage. According to the terrain and soil conditions it can be built on the ground or underground and divided into open and closed two categories, according to the shape characteristics it can be divided into circular and rectangular two, from different building materials it can be also divided into: brick pool, masonry pool, concrete pool, etc. The arrangement principle of the reservoir is basically the same as that of the water cellar.
				[NEWLINE] The remains of ancient Roman Cisterns are an impressive example of Roman construction. The La Malga reservoir was built by the Romans in the early 2nd century AD to store water from the Zaghouan mountains in a 132-kilometre-long aquift. Of the original 24 reservoirs, only 15 remain, each measuring 95m long, 12.5m wide and 11.50m high.

According to the story, a united humanity of the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, came to the land of Shinar (Hebrew: שנער‎).

				A sawmill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber (American English) or timber (British English). A sawmill's basic operation is much like those of hundreds of years ago; a log enters on one end and dimensional lumber exits on the other end. In the twentieth century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and expensive facilities in which most aspects of the work is computerized. The cost of a new facility with 2 mmfbm/day capacity is up to CAN$120,000,000. A modern operation will produce between 100 mmfbm and 700 mmfbm annually.

				The Feitoria - Portuguese for "factory" - were trading posts established in foreign territories during the Middle Ages. A feitoria served simultaneously as marketplace, warehouse, settlement, and staging point for exploration. Often established with a grant from the Portuguese crown, these private enterprises repaid their debt through the buying and selling of goods on behalf of the crown and through collecting taxes on trade that passed through their gates. During the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of over 50 feitoria were built along the coasts of west and east Africa, India, Malaya, China and Japan. The feitoria allowed Portugal to dominate the Atlantic and Indian Ocean trade routes for three centuries.

				Vienna has been an important center of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss II, among others, were associated with the city, with Schubert being born in Vienna. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music. Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments including the lute.

			<Text>The Inquisition, in historical ecclesiastical terminology also referred to as the "Holy Inquisition", was a group of institutions within the Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy. Torture and violence were used by the Inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics. The Inquisition started in 12th-century France to combat religious dissent, particularly among the Cathars and the Waldensians. The inquisitorial courts from this time until the mid-15th century are together known as the Medieval Inquisition. Other groups investigated during the Medieval Inquisition, which primarily took place in France and Italy, including the Spiritual Franciscans, the Hussites (followers of Jan Hus), and the Beguines. Beginning in the 1250s, inquisitors were generally chosen from members of the Dominican Order, replacing the earlier practice of using local clergy as judges.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, the scope of the Inquisition grew significantly in response to the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. It expanded to other European countries, resulting in the Spanish Inquisition and the Portuguese Inquisition. The Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions focused particularly on the anusim (people who were forced to abandon Judaism against their will) and on Muslim converts to Catholicism. The scale of the persecution of converted Muslims and converted Jews in Spain and Portugal was the result of suspicions that they had secretly reverted to their previous religions, although both minority groups were also more numerous on the Iberian Peninsula than in other parts of Europe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time, Spain and Portugal operated inquisitorial courts not only in Europe, but also throughout their empires in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. This resulted in the Goa Inquisition, the Peruvian Inquisition, and the Mexican Inquisition, among others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the exception of the Papal States, the institution of the Inquisition was abolished in the early 19th century, after the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and the Spanish American wars of independence in the Americas. The institution survived as part of the Roman Curia, but in 1908 it was renamed the "Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office". In 1965 it became the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. </Text>

It was constructed under orders of Saladin, Sultan of the Ayyubid Dynasty, between 1176 and 1183 CE, as part of a fortification effort to encircle the cities of Cairo and Fustat with a wall to protect against Crusaders. The citadel was to serve as the main defensive point in the wall. In order to supply the Citadel with water, and provide a source in the event of a siege, Saladin had the Well of Joseph constructed. The well is 85 metres (200 feet) deep, and has three hundred stairs leading to it in a spiral, hense the other name of Spiral Well. Water from this well was transported to the Citadel via a series of Aqueducts. Following the death of Suleiman and during the Mamluk dynasty, Al-Nasir Muhammed took control of the Citadel. This saw the Well of Joseph struggle with the ammount of water needed, so Al-Nasir commissioned a series of wells, fed by waterwheels on the Nile river and then moved through the citadels through Saladin's aqueducts. A series of mosques are also positioned in the Citadel, combining various sects of Islamic architecture, among which Ottoman and traditional Mamluk / Ayyubid. The Citadel also acted as the seat of Egypt's government, from the era of Saladin until the 19th century.  </Text>

			<Text>The Empire State Building is New York's tallest Skyscraper. It was constructed during the Great Depression in a competition between two other New York buildings (The Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street) to be the tallest in New York, America and the World at the time. Each held the title briefly, but the Empire State Building is the tallest, holding the title since 1930, when it was completed. It was surpassed by the construction of the World Trade Center towers, but is now the tallest again following the events of September 11, 2001. Upon construction of the 443 metre tall building, the top was originally hoped to be an Airship terminal for New York City, transporting passengers to the ground via two elevators. This, however, was deemed to risky due to updrafts caused by the size of the building. Along with the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building is a prime example of Art Deco architecture which was prominent during the Depression years of 1929-1932, and continued into World War 2. [NEWLINE] The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings on earth, and is a landmark of New York City. The top possesses three layers of lights, which illuminate different colours to support different events - Red, White and Blue for Independance Day, and completely Blue to honour Frank Sinatra upon his death. </Text>

			<Text>Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly known simply as Bauhaus, was an art school in Germany that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught. It operated from 1919 to 1933. At that time the German term About this Bauhaus - literally "house of construction" - was understood as meaning "School of Building". The Bauhaus was first founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar. The school existed in three German cities: Weimar from 1919 to 1925, Dessau from 1925 to 1932 and Berlin from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928, Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930 and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime. The Nazi government claimed that it was a centre of communist intellectualism. Though the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.</Text>

The dam has 32 main generators, each with an individual output of 700 mW, combining with other smaller generators for a combined total output of 22,500 mW, an ammount which would be able to power 6,750,000 homes every hour. Following the completion of the reservoir in 2003, the flooding of the area upstream from the dam resulted in the loss of several archaeological and cultural sites in the area, which resulted in harsh criticism from global agencies. </Text>

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The design of the buildings is a reflection of Malaysia's state religion of Islam, with many features of the building inspired by designs found in Islamic art and architecture. The shape of the tower is based on an islamic design known as the Rub el Hizb, which consists of two squares, one at a 45 degree angle to the other. In order to achieve the shape of the Petronas towers, the designers simply added a small circle at each intersection of the square outlines, which gave the shape. </Text>

It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan, on spacious grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east. Turtle Bay is occasionally used as a metonym for the U.N. headquarters or for the U.N. as a whole.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although it is situated in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police and fire protection and other services, the U.N. agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The United Nations Headquarters complex was constructed in stages with the core complex completed between 1948-1952. The Headquarters occupies a site beside the East River, on 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land purchased from the foremost New York real estate developer of the time, William Zeckendorf, Sr. Nelson Rockefeller arranged this purchase, after an initial offer to locate it on the Rockefeller family estate of Kykuit was rejected as being too isolated from Manhattan. The US$8.5 million purchase was then funded by his father, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who donated it to the city. Wallace Harrison, the personal architectural adviser for the Rockefeller family, and a prominent corporate architect, served as the Director of Planning for the United Nations Headquarters. His firm, Harrison and Abramovitz, oversaw the execution of the design.</Text>

				A wildlife preserve is a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora or fauna, which is reserved and managed for conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research. Nature reserves may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Organized whale watching dates back to 1950 when the Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public venue for observing Gray Whales. In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters. Today whale watching is estimated to be worth up to $2.1 billion per annum worldwide to whale watching operations, employing around 13,000 workers. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.

				Cable Internet is a form of broadband Internet access that uses the cable television infrastructure. Like digital subscriber line and fiber to the premises services, cable Internet access provides network edge connectivity (last mile access) from the Internet service provider to an end user. It is integrated into the cable television infrastructure analogously to DSL which uses the existing telephone network. Cable TV networks and telecommunications networks are the two predominant forms of residential Internet access. Recently, both have seen increased competition from fiber deployments, wireless, and mobile networks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cable television is a system of providing television to consumers via radio frequency signals transmitted to televisions through fixed optical fibers or coaxial cables located on the subscriber's property, much like the over-the-air method used in traditional television broadcasting (via radio waves) in which a television antenna is required. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephony, and similar non-television services may also be provided. The major difference is the change of radio frequency signals used and optical connections to the subscriber property.

			<Text>Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.Electric power is usually produced by electric generators, but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries. It is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry through an electric power grid. Electric power is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using an electricity meter, which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer.</Text>

				Decentralization (or decentralisation) is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. While decentralization, especially in the governmental sphere, is widely studied and practiced, there is no common definition or understanding of decentralization. The meaning of decentralization may vary in part because of the different ways it is applied.

			<Text>Collectivization in the Soviet Union was enforced under Stalin between 1928 and 1940. The goal of this policy was to consolidate individual land and labour into collective farms: mainly kolkhozy and sovkhozy. The Soviet leadership was confident that the replacement of individual peasant farms by collective ones would immediately increase the food supply for urban population, the supply of raw materials for processing industry, and agricultural exports. Collectivization was thus regarded as the solution to the crisis of agricultural distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed since 1927. This problem became more acute as the Soviet Union pressed ahead with its ambitious industrialization program.</Text>

			<Text>Hegemony is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BC – 6th century AD), hegemony denoted the politico-military dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the hegemon. In the 19th century, hegemony came to denote the "Social or cultural predominance or ascendancy; predominance by one group within a society or milieu". Later, it could be used to mean "a group or regime which exerts undue influence within a society". Also, it could be used for the geopolitical and the cultural predominance of one country over others, from which was derived hegemonism, as in the idea that the Great Powers meant to establish European hegemony over Africa, Asia and Latin America.</Text>
			<!--<Text>Chauvinism, in its original meaning, is an exaggerated patriotism and a belligerent belief in national superiority and glory.According to legend, French soldier Nicolas Chauvin was badly wounded in the Napoleonic wars. He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin was a fanatical Bonapartist despite the unpopularity of this view in Bourbon Restoration France. His single-minded blind devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.

				ong before the development of the hwachas, China imposed severe restrictions on exporting gunpowder to Joseon Korea, fiercely guarding a military asset. Yet gunpowder weapons were key to the Koreans in maintaining a predominant navy in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to protect fishermen and merchants against the increasing numbers of invading Japanese and Wokou pirates. In response, there was an effort by Koreans to develop gunpowder on their own. Korea first began production of gunpowder during the period 1374–76. In 1377 a Korean scholar named Choe Mu-seon discovered a way to obtain it by extracting potassium nitrate from the soil and subsequently invented the juhwa, Korea's very first rocket.Further developments led to the birth of the family of singijeons. The hwacha was a further development from the juhwa and the singijeon. The first hwacha was developed in Korea in 1409 during the Joseon Dynasty.

			<Text>The Age of Discovery is a historical period of European global exploration that started in the early 15th century with the first Portuguese discoveries in the Atlantic archipelagos and Africa, as well as the discovery of America by Spain in 1492, and the discovery of the ocean route to the East in 1498, and by a series of European naval expeditions across the Atlantic and later the Pacific, which continued until the 18th century. It is sometimes regarded as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era, along with its contemporary Renaissance movement. European overseas expansion led to the rise of colonial empires, with the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the Columbian Exchange: a wide transfer of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases and culture between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. </Text>

Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering. Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, the 1920s saw extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of World War I military aircraft. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments. </Text>

The materials are usually arranged in repeating patterns, often at microscopic or smaller scales that are smaller than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Metamaterials derive their properties not from the properties of the base materials, but from their designed structure. Their precise shape, geometry, size, orientation and arrangement gives them their properties.</Text>

				Portuguese wine is the result of traditions introduced to the region by ancient civilizations, such as the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and mostly the Romans. Portugal started to export its wines to Rome during the Roman Empire. Modern exports developed with trade to England after the Methuen Treaty in 1703. From this commerce a wide variety of wines started to be grown in Portugal. And, in 1758, one of the first wine-producing region of the world, the Região Demarcada do Douro was created under the orientation of Marquis of Pombal, in the Douro Valley. Portugal has two wine producing regions protected by UNESCO as World Heritage: the Douro Valley Wine Region (Douro Vinhateiro) and Pico Island Wine Region (Ilha do Pico Vinhateira). Portugal has a big variety of local kinds, producing a very wide variety of different wines with distinctive personality.

The Brazilian national football team has won the FIFA World Cup tournament a record five times, in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002, and is the only team to succeed in qualifying for every World Cup competition ever held. It is among the favorites to win the trophy every time the competition is scheduled. After Brazil won its 3rd World Cup in 1970, they were awarded the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_YIELD_FOOD]Operation:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Fixed Unit, can NOT move.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]After finishing building a Citadel Improvement, a Citadel Unit is created on that tile Citadel.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you order your worker to change the Citadel Improvement into other kinds of Improvements, its Citadel Unit will be also removed.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the city where the Citadel is captured by the enemy, the Citadel Unit suffers -50 HP per turn and -50% [ICON_STRENGTH]Combat Strength due to lack of supply, so it will be destroyed in two turns if you don't retake that city.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Citadel units are structures indeed so they can NOT earn Promotions.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Land-based Aircrafts are allowed to deployed on the Citadel tile with a Firebase or Military Airbase.


				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Pros:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Great Defensive Structure
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]No [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower cost


				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_NEGATIVE_TEXT]Cons:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Expensive Maintenance Cost
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Don't think you can be free from invasion only by building servel Citadels. They cannot move so the enemy can easily take a detour.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use its sight and firepower to keep an eye on your territory while your troops are on the frontline, especially for areas with important resources or choke points in case of possible enemy harassment.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]It is a relatively cheap way to deploy Land-based Aircrafts outside your cities. Build them on safe areas to allow your aircrafts to extend their flight range.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Like other strategy games, Siege Units have great combat bonus against Citadel Units. One Siege Units can destroy a firebase easily from a long distance.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]It is a waste of time to mess with an enemy's Citadel Unit not in your way. You could simply bypass it and take the enemy's city directly.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you are embroiled in an unexpected war, or attacked by barbarians, but you have no or few military units. Transfer your Workers to Militia Units to buy you some time.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bring some Militia Units with "Military Reserve" promotion to frontline during an invasion to serve as medical troops. What's more, they are competent cannon fodder to waste enemy's firepower.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They cannot defeat your professional army in a fair fight. If outnumbered, call artillery or air-ground support like in the real life.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]One experienced Special Forces Unit (with "Blitz" and "Sabotage Cities" Promotion) can capture a small city in the same turn after paradropping. If carefully planned, you can completely destory a nation in one turn.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Hit-and-run Units are not so "easy to use" for new players. Careful plan and mirco control are required to make full use of these units. You have four different ways to bring them into play.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]1. Scouting: Before attacking enemy's units, send Hit-and-run Units with "Scouting" promotions to move next to the target. This will reduce the target's defense as well as providing flank bonus to make your attack more efficient. In most cases, the first Hit-and-run Units you trained should choose this promotion.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2. Adding Debuff: If you face strong enemy units, like advanced units, elite units and experimental units, use Hit-and-run Units with "Sunder" promotions to attack them to reduce thier combat strength in defence. The "sunder" effect can be multiplied to -50% combat strength, so you can kill enemy's units even two eras ahead of yours.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]3. Hunt Down: Hit-and-run Units with "Hunt Down" promotions have significant combat bonus against wounded units (even a unit with 99 HP is also considered "wounded"). As a result, they are very powerful to finish up enemy's debuffed or escaping units, especailly those on the other side of a river.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]4. Gank: Besides working as a support unit. A group of 3-5 Hit-and-run Units is able to work alone as a tactical team with high mobility. One unit with "Scouting" promotions provides reconnaissance, while 1-2 unit(s) with"Sunder" promotions softening the enemy and 1-3 unit(s) with "Hunt Down" promotions to finish the enemy up. Such a tactical team can defeat almost all kinds of combination of enemy units in all terrains, without any loss.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Hit-and-run Units cannot function as your main force due to its low combat strength and high training cost. Make sure they are back to safe areas by the end of your turn. They are vulnerable while defending.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Protect your experienced Hit-and-run Units. They are high value units and can fight much more efficiently than rookies.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Remember Hit-and-run Units can perform both melee attacks and ranged attacks. Use melee attacks against enemy's Ranged Units while use ranged attacks for enemy melee units to minimize your casualties.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are weak while defending and can be easily defeated by your main force units. Beaware that enemy's units with "Hunt Down" promotions also have combat bonus while defending. You should use unit of full HP to attack them.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]With an advantage of shooting range and great combat bonus, Archery Units can easily kill enemy's mounted archers while Anti-air Units can quickly bring down enemy's helicopters. Stack Archery Units or Anti-air Units with Infantry Units or Counter Units to defend your flanks.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always keep a neat formation to leave no gaps for enemy's Hit-and-run Units to slip in.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Archery Units and Anti-air Units are very different from their counterparts in BNW. They are no longer main force units as they shoudl be. They are support units and must work with other units for a better output.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Units with "Barrage" Promotions can paralyze any enemy's units. Use it to disable strong enemies which cannot be killed in the current turn. This is very helpful if you are outnumbered.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The perfect defensive formation: stack an Infantry Unit, an Counter Unit, a Citadel Unit or a Militia Unit with a Ranged Unit which has "Fire Support" promotions together during defensive turns.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always keep your Fighters upgraded to the most advanced models. Dated Fighters will suffer a crushing defeat fighting against advanced Fighters due to the huge gap of their combat strength and flight range.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The most effective method against enemy's Fighters is to build more Fighters or build advanced Fighters to overwhelm the enemy.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Pros:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the attack is successful, it can destroy any land or naval units of its era in one shot

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_NEGATIVE_TEXT]Cons:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Weak when intercepted
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Relatively short flight range

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Since its attacks ignore all terrain or any defensive bonus, it is extremely efficient to take down enemy's units hiding in rough terrains like deep forest or jungles.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Attack Aircrafts also have a deadly effect attacking enemy's naval ships. With enough Attack Aircrafts accompanied by Fighters, you are able to take out the enemy's fleet while your main naval force is out.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]With "Surgical Strike" promotions, Attack Aircrafts can even damage or destroy enemy's units in the city. Be aware they can damage or destroy enemy's aircrafts stationed in the target city as well. Use Fighters to clear a path and your Attack Aircrafts can wipe out enemy's air force on their runways in one turn.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Move up your Attack Aircrafts while pushing further, since they have a relatively shorter flight range.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Attack Aircrafts don't have any anti-air weapons. As a result, they are bobbing target for Fighters.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A land Anti-air Unit or Military Airbase (Citadel Unit) may not be able to shoot down an Attack Aircraft during interception. But it will cause severe damage to the Attack Aircraft and protect your unit under its attack.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use its "Air Siege I" promotion to destroy enemy's military production to paralyze the war capability. What's more, the target city will be more vulnerable after its military buildings destroyed.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you want to bring further impact to your enemy's economy, use Strategic Bombers with "Air Siege II" and "Air Siege III" promotions to bomb enemy's main cities to destroy its production buildings adn power plants. This is especially effective if you want to stop your opponent from launching spaceship. However, if you want to capture and make use of the target city, do not do so. Otherwise you will destroy your own buildings.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Strategic Bombers can also be used for tactical bombing by gaining "Supply Line Bombardment" which can cause chaos to enemy's invading units, especially for enemy's naval units.

Although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has often been credited as the most effective, efficient and influential tank design of the Second World War. At its introduction, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its heavy sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. When first encountered in 1941, the German tank general von Kleist called it "the finest tank in the world" and Heinz Guderian confirmed the T-34's "vast superiority" over existing German armour of the period. </Text>

				Employed initially as tribal irregulars, then in regular contingents, the goumiers were employed extensively during the French occupation of Morocco from 1908 to the early 1930s. They then served in Italy and France during World War II between 1942 and 1945. During this period four Moroccan Tabors Groupments (GTM) were created, each comprising 3 Tabors (battalion) with 3 to 4 Goums (companies). Goumiers then served in Indochina from 1946 to 1954.

			<Text>A kinetic bombardment or a kinetic orbital strike is the hypothetical act of attacking a planetary surface with an inert projectile, where the destructive force comes from the kinetic energy of the projectile impacting at very high velocities. The concept is often encountered in science fiction and originated during the Cold War.The typical depiction of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the satellite would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a geostationary position while directly over the target. The rod would then begin to fall towards the earth, picking up immense speed until it reached terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would often be shaped so as to increase the terminal velocity. In science fiction, the tactic is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship, instead of a satellite.

			The temples in the Aztec Empire were terraced pyramids topped by a temple, which was the site of all the important religious ceremonies in the region. The Temple of Huey (or, as it is called in Spanish, the Great Temple), the grandest temple, stands in the center of Tenochtitlan and is dedicated to two gods: Vezilo, the god of war Pochitelli and Tadoc, the god of agriculture (this also shows what was important in Aztec culture). Each deity has a separate temple, reached by a separate staircase. Mesoamerican pyramids were often rebuilt, using the original structures as bases for new towers that were continually enlarged. Thus, after its completion in 1325, the Temple of Huey was rebuilt six times. During its seventh and final construction, it was sacked and destroyed by Cortes and his conquerors. Only a few ruins remain, but people still indulge in eccentric celebrations of it...such as the fifteenth month celebration of the god of war, Vitzilopochtli, where amaranth is enshrined Deities made of plant seeds, bones, honey and human blood, which were then left for the common people to eat.

The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century.It became a princely state of British India in 1890.

In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a referendum under surveillance with Indian army was held that led to the dissolution of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.

				An Iziko is a simple hearth used as a gathering place for Zulu communities。The fireplace was revered as a source for food，warmth，dreams，and ancestral ties。It is from these gatherings that a sense of community and identity was formed，and young Zulus could perform and bond。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The fireplace is used metaphorically for the "cooking of songs" in isicathamiya stage performances，a modern offshoot of traditional Zulu music。Dreams were an essential part of communicating with ancestors and formed part of a deeply rooted Zulu religion。Some isicathamiya musicians claim some of their songs were created in the spiritual realm or given to them by their ancestors。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
